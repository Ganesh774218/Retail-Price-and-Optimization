# Retail-Price-and-Optimization
# 🧾 Retail Price Optimization Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail pricing data to uncover insights that support **data-driven pricing decisions**. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and descriptive statistics, the project evaluates how price, quantity, product category, and temporal factors influence sales and revenue.

The analysis serves as a foundation for **price optimization, elasticity modeling, and dynamic pricing strategies**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze price distributions and detect outliers across products and categories  
- Study the relationship between **unit price, quantity sold, and total price**  
- Evaluate the impact of **product category, weekday, and holidays** on sales behavior  
- Identify correlations among numerical variables to guide future modeling  
- Provide actionable insights for **pricing optimization and experimentation**

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **File:** `retail_price.csv`
- **Key Features:**
  - `unit_price`
  - `qty`
  - `total_price`
  - `product_category_name`
  - `weekday`
  - `holiday`
  - (Optional) competitor pricing variables

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **Plotly (Express & Graph Objects)** – interactive visualizations  

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of total price  
- Box plot of unit price to detect outliers  
- Quantity vs total price relationship  
- Category-wise revenue comparison  
- Weekday and holiday-based pricing patterns  

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Heatmap of numerical features  
- Identification of multicollinearity and key drivers  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Total price shows a **strong linear relationship** with quantity sold  
- Significant price and revenue variation across product categories  
- Temporal patterns indicate opportunities for **event-based and dynamic pricing**  
- Limited price sensitivity for some products suggests room for controlled price increases  

---

## ✅ Conclusions
- Current pricing is stable but largely static  
- Category-specific and time-based pricing strategies can unlock additional revenue  
- Next steps include **competitor benchmarking, elasticity modeling, and A/B testing**
